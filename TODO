We need to check :
https://dev.to/kedar9/creating-a-node-app-with-react-webpack-4-babel-7-express-and-sass-3mae

And merge it with mern-starter along with material-ui

Backend is merged with testing
@material-ui is installed

But I need to find common between mern-starter and Andrew code.

if they use sass, I need to use webpack configuration from above. 
Otherwise it should work
